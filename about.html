            <h1>hi! i'm sofia, a visual-minded journalist.</h1>
            <p>I am driven by my undying creative streak that often pulls me towards many different interests at once. Previously, I was the fall 2019 photo editor of the <i>Daily Free Press</i>, Boston University’s award-winning, independent publication. I enjoy film photography and have dabbled in <i>documentary filmmaking</i>, something I long to one day return to.</p>
        
            <p>Despite my love affair with photography, <i>writing</i> is my lifelong devotion. I have been an editorial intern at <i>Los Angeles</i> and <i>Boston</i> Magazine—-both wonderful experiences covering the two cities that have most shaped me. While abroad in London, I wrote for online arts and culture blog <a href="https://dulwichonview.org.uk/author/sdkoyama/" alt="a link to sofia koyama's dulwich onview author page"><i>Dulwich Onview</i></a> and grew intimately close with the spunky South London community of Dulwich.</p>
            
            <p>In the future, I hope to serve in <i>bridge-roles</i> where I can close the gaps between my various interests and infuse data- and visual-driven reporting into cohesive and immersive stories. I am deeply passionate about protecting local journalism, the intersectionality of issues and newsroom diversity.</p>
            
            <p>I like learning new things! Most recently, I learned HTML/CSS (with the internet as my teacher, of course) and coded this website from scratch. Other current aspirations include strengthening my graphic design skills and learning more languages!</p>
            
            <p>In my spare time, I love curating <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/thwondersofia?si=WZWVdWC8Ro6jM3mZEwrHXQ" alt="a link to sofia koyama's spotify">playlists</a> and listening to/watching comedy. I often lament that if I were only funnier, I would aspire to write for Last Week Tonight.</p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;My pronouns are <i>she/her</i>. You can contact me at <i>sdkoyama</i> (at) gmail (dot) com.</p>
